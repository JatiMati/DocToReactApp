<h1> Project testing my ability of creating one page application using React. </h1>

Description: 
A simple application for storing and adding patients to the database.
Sample patients are taken from
https://randomuser.me/

In the future, adding visits to the calendar will be implemented if I fix it first.



Callendar is missing functionality (will implement them soooooon or maybe not)
